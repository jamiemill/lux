          h1 A Few Backbone.js Tips
          p Which mostly apply to JavaScript development in general.

      .slide
        .slide-content
          h2 Don't store data in the DOM
          ul
            li Avoid ambiguity of state/data spread between JS and HTML
            li Data truth &rarr; belongs in model instances.
            li UI state truth &rarr; belongs in view instances.
            li The DOM is not a source of truth.
            li Should be able to re-render views any time without worrying about losing some state from the DOM.

        .slide-content
          h2 Don't store data in the DOM (Example)
          p To store which tab a user has activated:
          p Not so good:
          pre
            | <div data-current-tab="open-ideas">...</div>
          p Better:
            pre
              | myView.currentTab = OPEN_IDEAS;

      .slide
        .slide-content
          h2 Treat the DOM as write-only
          ul
            li Data flows towards the DOM, not back.
            li Paint and re-paint the DOM like a canvas.
            li Don't read from it.
            li (except for user input)

      .slide
        .slide-content
          h2 Be declarative
          ul
            li Cuts down on boilerplate
            li Shows intention over implementation

      .slide
        .slide-content
          h2 Be declarative (with DOM events)
          p Not so good:
            pre
              | this.$('.load-more').click(this.load_more);
          p Better:
            pre
              | // inside a view class
              | events: {
              |   'click .load-more': 'load_more',
              | }

      .slide
        .slide-content
          h2 Be declarative (with templates, where possible)
          p Not so good:
            pre
              | this.$('.some-div').append(some_subtemplate());
          p Better:
            pre
              | <div class="some-div">
              |   {{> some_handlebars_partial}}
              | </div>

      .slide
        .slide-content
          h2 Use the router generously
          ul
            li Push navigational state up to the URL
            li Allows:
              ul
                li Refreshing without losing location
                li Bookmarking/sharing location
                li Back button

      .slide
        .slide-content
          h2 Use the router generously
          pre
            | var AppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
            |   routes: {
            |     'report/:year/:month': 'report'
            |   }
            | });
          pre
            | appRouter.navigate('report/2012/11', {trigger: true});
